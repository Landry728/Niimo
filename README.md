niimo - Don't Stop Searching.

This is a networking platform built with React. Created in the Spring of 2019 by Michael Banks, Cordey Jones, John McDaniel, 
Landry Leopard, and Cameron Smith. We designed this application in an effort to combat a major issue in our home city:
abandoned & vacant buildings. Via our platform, citizens of our city can connect with others, sharing their thoughts and ideas
on specific commercial estates for sale or lease that have been long forgotten. We hope that with this application the great
city of Birmingham, Alabama, can become greater. From facilitating the aspects of investments, to informative
collections of assorted properties. The capacity of this application for Birmingham's prosperity and expansion are boundless.
